## 🧠 Methodology

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed student data to understand patterns in academic performance, internships, and placement outcomes.
- Visualized distributions and correlations among features (e.g., CGPA, extracurriculars, specialization).

### 📊 Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing
- Performed hypothesis tests to evaluate the impact of categorical and continuous features on placement results.
- Identified statistically significant predictors (e.g., branch, work experience, projects).

### 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Built and evaluated multiple ML classifiers to predict placement outcomes.
- Achieved **~90% accuracy** using models like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - XG Boost
  - Cat Boost
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
